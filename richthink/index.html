            <h1>Introduction</h1>

            <p>
                    This is a book review on the famous book 'Think
    And Grow Rich', written by Napolean Hill. In it, the author talks about 13 key principles for
    success. My goal is to help as many people as I can to become succesful and
    reach their goals. " Whatever the mind can
    concive and believe the mind can achive" -Napolean Hill.
    Understanding this quote is critical, because if you
    don't, it may ruin your chances of understanding the other
    principles within the book. Everything we see around us originiated in the mind of one or more individuals.
    Whatever we can think of and believe in, we can accomplish.
    It is as simple as that. Reading these
    principles will give you more information to why
    the above statement is true.


    As a passonite learner of psychology,
      I realized that the brain plays a leading role in getting what I want. It plays
such a significant role that I have a section of how the brain works before we get in the success rules.
It is imparitive to not skip or scan through the section on the brain.

            <h1>Power of the mind </h1>
            <p>"Whatever the mind can concive and believe the mind can achive" - Napolean Hill. Our thoughgts hold
                significant powers within them.
                Everything in life is energy including our thought impulses. Everything you see with your eyes
                was once thought of in the mind of one or more individuals.
                Our thoughts can be amped up by mixing them with positve emotions. The seven most powerful positive emotions are
                desire, love, faith, enthusiasm, romance, hope, and sex. According to Napolean Hill sex is
                by far the strongest emotion.
                Although this sounds great, there is a negative component in this universal law. If we don't take control of our mind
                then negative forces will take control of it for us. There are seven major negative emotions which is fear, jealousy,
                hatred, revenge, greed, superstition, and anger.
                When we was born we was gifted with the equivilant of two sealed envelops said Andrew Carnigie
                (One of the richest man in history in the 19th century).
                One labeled the riches you may enjoy if you take posession of your own mind and the other labeled "the penalties you must
                pay if you neglect to taken possesion of your own mind". The content in the sealed envelope labeled riches  is
                sound health, peace of mind,
                a labor of love of your own choice, freedom from fear and worry, positive mental attitude, material riches of your own
                choice and quantity. In the sealed envelope labeled "penalties you must pay for neglecting to take possesion of
                your own mind" is this list of undesirable circumstances; ill health, fear and worry, indecision and doubt,
                frustration and discouragement through out life, poverty and want, envy, greed, jealousy, anger, hatered,
                and superstition. The purpose for this artical is to help everyone to unlock the powers within themselves by
                learning how to use there mind in a constuctive rather than destructive manner. The rules below was inspired by Napolean Hill
                famous principles. I added my flavor to the principles to make them unique to me. I put everything in the most simplest form
                so that everyone can and will understand. Before reading my rules understand that you will only receive this message once you are ready.</p>

            <section><h1>Rule One: Know What You Want</h1>
                <p>You can't be successful if you don't have a goal you're aiming for. "Success is a progressive realization of a worthy ideal"
                    said Earl Nightengale. Put in another way; a person is successful if he knows where he is going and is working
                    towards his goal. If a man dreamed of being a comidian and he becomes one he is successful, because that is what he
                    wanted to do. After knowing what you want there are simple steps in getting it.
                     The only way to get what you want out of life is to have a burning desire for its attainment.
                     By causing your mind to concentrate
                    on your goals and asperations you cause your mind to have an obsesion for it.
                    When your brain is so focused on a task, it sinks in the subconsios mind. We will talk more about the subconsios
                    mind more in a later rule but to keep it brief; when you form a mental images in your mind, it gets into your subconsios.
                    Once the thought gets in the subconsios, then our action become  automatic. More times then not, when the thought are
                    in the subconsios mind ideas will come from your intuition. The idea flashes through the mind quick so you have to catch it.
                    With that being said the first step is to
                    know what you want and plant a mental image of it in your mind. If it's more money ask yourself how much. Would you see
                    it in a bank account, or in your hands? Second, determine excatly what you plan to give in return for what you want.
                    There is no such thing as somthing for nothing. Third, determine a definate date when you intend to possess the
                    money or the thing you want. Fourth, make a definate plan for carrying out your desire. And start immiditaly to
                    put that plan to action "if you are ready or not". Fifth Write out a clear coinsice statement of what you want, name the
                    time limit for its attainment, state what you inted to give in return for what you want and define clearing your plan.
                    And lastly read your writin statement twice a day. Once when you wake up and once after retiring for bed.
                    As you read see, feel and believe your self already reaching your goal. It is very important to follow these steps,
                    especially the last one. You can judge your determination on how eagar you are to apply these sound rules. A
                    burning desire is the first step to success.</p>

                <h1>Rule Two: Have Faith</h1>
        <p>
          If you don't have faith in your vision and in yourself you will never be successful! Without faith ,
          none of the rules can work. "When faith is blended with the vibration of thought, the subconsios mind instantly
          picks up the vibration,translate it into its spiritual equivilant, and transmits it to infinite intelligence,
          as in the case of prayer." -Napolean Hill. This is extremly important because we are getting into the spiritual side
          of things. The emotion of love and faith is related to our spiritual side while the sex emotion is related to our
          physical side. The mixing of these three emotions has the effect of opening a direct line of
          communication between the finite, thinking mind and infinite intelligence. Some people lack faith in themselves,
          but there is a confidence formula they can follow. Before getting in the formula understand; faith is a state of
          mind that can only be developed by repeating affiramations to your subconsios mind. Self confidence formula.
          Remember the following statements: 1. I know that I have the ability to achive the object of my Definate Purpose in life.
          Therefore I demand of myself persistent, continuous action towards its attainment, and I here and now promise to take
          such action. 2. I realize the dominating thoughts of my will eventually reproduce themselves in outward, physical
          reality. Therefore I will concentrate my thoughts for 30 minutes daily upon the task of thinking of the person I
          intend to become., thereby creating in my mind a clear mental picture of that person. 3. I know through the principle
          of autosuggestion that any desire I persistently hold in my mind will eventually seek expression through some practical
          means of attaining the object. Therefore I will devote 10 minutes daily to demanding myself the development of
          sel-confidence. 4. I have clearly written down a description of my Definite Cheif Aim in life. I will never stop
          trying until I have developed sufficient self-confidence for its attainment. 5. I fully realize that no wealth
          or position can long endure unless built upon truth and justice. Therefore I will engage in no transaction that does
          not benefit all whom it affects. I will succeed by attracting to myself the forces I wish to use, and the cooperation
          of other people. I will induce others to serve me because of my willingness to serve others. I will eliminate
          hatred, envy, jealousy, selfishness and cynicism by developing love for all humanity because I know that a negative
          attitude towards others can never bring me success. I will cause others to believe in me, because I will believe
          in them, and in myself. I will sign my name to this formula, commit it to memory and repeat it aloud once a day,
          with full faith that it will gradually influence my thoughts adn actions so that I will become a self-reliant and
          successful person. The self confidence formula was found in Think And Grow Rich. </p>

            <section>

                <h1>Rule Three: Autosuggestion</h1>
                <p>Autosuggestion is the only way a person can voluntarily influence the subconsios mind. To put
                    anothor way, autosuggestion is self-suggestion from oneself to oneself, another word for affiramations.
                    Once our thoughts are in our subconsios mind then things, circumstances, and people will gravitate towards us.
                    Only thoughts that have been well emotionalized can reach and influence the subconsios mind. You can say to yourself over and
                    over again a positive affiramation, but if your words are not mixed or blended with positive emotions then it
                    will never bring you your desired results. Not understanding the importance of emotionalized thought is the reason
                    majority of people that try to use these principle fail. You will get no desirable results until you learn
                    to reach your subconsios mind with thoughts or spoken words that have been well emotionalized with faith. Don't be
                    discouraged if you can't direct your emotions the first time. Remember that there is no such reality as somthing for nothing.
                    In order to master your emotions you must pay the price and the price is everlasting persistence in applying
                    this rule. The following formula is in Think And Grow Rich: 1. Go into some quiet spot (preferably in bed at night)
                    where you will not be disturbed or interrupted. Close your eyes and repeat aloud (so you may hear your own words)
                    the written statment of the amount of money you intend to accumulate, the time limit for its accumulation, and
                    a description of the service or merchandise you intend to give in return for the money. As you carry out these
                    instructions, see yourself already in possesion of the money. 2. Repeat this program night and morning until
                    you can see (in your imagination) the money you intend to accumulate. 3. Place3 a written copy of your statement
                    where you can see it night and morning. Read it just before retiring and upon rising until it had been memorized.
                    Remember while you are carrying out these instructions you are giving orders to your subconsios mind.</p>

                <h1> Four: Specialized Knowledge </h1>
                <p>There are two different types of Knowledge. One being general knowledge and the other being
                    Specialized knowledge. General knowledge, no matter the varity or quantity, is of litle use in the accumulation
                    of money. Many people have the misunderstanding that knowledge is power. Knowledge is only potental power when,
                    and if it is organized and planed to a definate end. "knowledge will not attract money unless it is organized
                    and intellignetly directed through practical plans of action to the definite end of accumulation of money" -Napolean Hill
                    You can gain specialized knowledge from the following; 1.Your own experience and education. 2. Experience and
                    education available through cooperation of others. 3. Colleges and universities. 4. Public libraries. 5. Special
                    training courses. After this knowledge is aquired and understood it must be organized and put into use,
                    for a definate purpose, through practical plans. Knowledge without action is fruitless. If you have Knowledge
                    that does not help toward your goal then it's useless. You should only seek knowledge that can help you achive
                    your purpose.</p>

                <h1>Rule Five: Imagination </h1>
                <p>You can create anything you can imagine. Whatever we imagine or visialize sooner or later we will
                    see the equivilant in its physical form. There are two types of imagination. One being synthetic imagination and the
                    other being creative imagination. Synthetic imagination is when someone uses old concepts, ideas or plans
                    into new combinations. Through creative imagination the finite mind of man has direct communication with
                    infinite intelligence. Here is where hunches and inspirations are given to you. This is where all basic or
                    new ideas are created. Through this falculty, thought vibrations of other minds are picked up. Through this
                    falculty you can also tune into or comunicate with the subconsios mind of others.</p>

                <h1> Rule Six: Organized planning</h1>
                <p>Making organized plans is essential to success in
                    any calling. The following are four steps in building practical plans
                    1. Ally yourself with a group of as many people as you may need for the creation and carrying out of your plan, or
                     plans, for the accumulation of money,
                    making use of the “mastermind” principle.
	                   2.	Before forming your “mastermind” alliance, decide what advantages and benefits you may offer the individual
                     members of your group in return for their cooperation. “No intelligent person will either request or
                     expect another to work without adequate compensation, although this may not always be in the form of money.”
	                    3.	Arrange to meet with the members of your “mastermind” group at least twice a week, and more often if possible,
                       until you have collectively perfected the necessary plan or plans, for the accumulation of money.
	                     4.	Maintain perfect harmony between yourself and every memo in your mastermind group. (This is necessary).</p>
