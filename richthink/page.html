                    <p>I'm a student that goes to Alabama A&M University and graduated from  McCluer North Highschool in 2020 (Covid Year).
                         I grew up with two parents, two sisters, and my grandmom that lived with us until she moved out. Althogh I had great parents
                         that cared for me, they couldn't afford to get me everything I wanted. I literilly wanted everything!
                        Ever since I realized I need money to acquire the material possesions I crave, I wanted to become rich ever since.
                    By the age of 16, I decided to take matters in my own hands. I start looking for a job and couldn't find one. Eventuelly, after a month or two,
                I landed my first job. I thought this was all I need to reach the next level but, it wasn't. I realized I was living paycheck to
            paycheck saving little to no money. I knew I wanted better for myself. I ask myself "what should I do?" I always knew books were cheat-codes
            to life but I never knew what books to read. Being logical I decided to look up best self-help books. This is where my life changed.
            I came across books like "The 48 Laws Of Power", "Think And Grow Rich", "Rich Dad Poor Dad", "How To Win Friends And Influence People",
            and many more. Remember, no matter how many books you read or how much knowledge you get, it will be fruitless if you don't put it into action. If you need
            any help or have any questions, feel free to contact me via email.
